# E-commerce Churn Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focusing on customer churn prediction for an e-commerce company. The project explores customer behavior, predicts churn, and segments churned users to help the company reduce churn and offer targeted promotions.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project addresses the following objectives:
1. **Understanding Churned Users' Patterns and Behaviors:**
   - Identify patterns and behaviors of churned users.
   - Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.
   
2. **Building a Machine Learning Model:**
   - Develop and fine-tune a model to predict customer churn.

3. **Customer Segmentation for Targeted Promotions:**
   - Segment churned users into distinct groups.
   - Highlight differences between these groups to enable personalized promotions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps in the Project

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed churn patterns using customer attributes like tenure, login preferences, and order behavior.
   - Identified correlations and trends between features and churn status.

### 2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Built and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict churn.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Clustered churned users into distinct groups using clustering techniques.
   - Highlighted behavioral differences across groups for targeted marketing.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Results and Recommendations

### **Key Findings**
- Churned users tend to have lower satisfaction scores, fewer recent orders, and higher complaints.
- Customers with higher order frequency and cashback amounts are less likely to churn.

### **Recommendations**
- Improve customer satisfaction by addressing complaints promptly.
- Offer loyalty programs with targeted cashback or discounts for users at risk of churning.
- Develop personalized marketing strategies based on user segmentation insights.
